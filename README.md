Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction 🚀
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a telecom company using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning modeling, and business insights. The goal is to identify factors influencing churn, build predictive models, and provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention.

🛠️ Key Tasks & Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preparation

Handled missing values and converted categorical variables into numerical form.
Split dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Calculated overall churn rate and visualized customer distributions by gender, contract type, and payment methods.
Analyzed tenure distribution and its relation to churn.
3️⃣ Customer Segmentation

Segmented customers based on tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.
Identified high-value customers at risk of churning.
4️⃣ Churn Prediction Model

Built machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) to predict customer churn.
Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5️⃣ Model Evaluation & Business Recommendations

Interpreted feature importance to identify key churn drivers.
Suggested strategies like contract incentives, payment flexibility, and customer retention programs to reduce churn by 15-30%.
📊 Technologies Used
✅ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
✅ Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)
✅ Data Visualization & Statistical Analysis

📈 Key Takeaways
Short-tenure & month-to-month contract customers churn more.
Electronic check payments increase churn risk.
Targeted retention strategies can significantly reduce churn & increase revenue.
🚀 This project showcases how data-driven insights can drive business decisions and improve customer retention!
